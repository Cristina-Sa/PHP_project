# PHP_project

In this repository we will develop a form in PHP from one database.

The form can be accessed through: http://localhost/PHP_PROJECT/formulario.html as long as the following conditions are met:

1. You are running in XAMPP:
- the Apache web server
- the MySQL database 

2. You have a database called CursoSQL on your server (localhost if you are using XAMPP) where the table USUARIO is stored.  
3. The PHP_PROJECT folder is stored in the /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs folder.

> **Note**
> 
> **XAMPP**: is a ready-made package (called bundles) that installs all the necessary resources to be able to work with PHP.
